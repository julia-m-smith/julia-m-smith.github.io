What we think is right and who we think we are inform one another. We routinely use aspects of our identities, like our religious affiliations and political orientations, to inform our moral decision making. On the other hand, we also use our moral beliefs to inform our views of ourselves and others. 

I study moral and self-relevant reasoning using a cross-cultural framework that takes into account the world's vast diversity of moral beliefs and self-concepts. I am particularly interested in how understanding the ways in which we reason through these fundamental topics can help us better understand interpersonal and intergroup conflict and cooperation. 

I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Duke University [Mind and Culture Lab](https://www.mindandculturelab.com/).
