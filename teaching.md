## Teaching with Dungeons and Dragons
In my course "Decision Processes through Dungeons and Dragons", students learn about research in the field of Judgment and Decision Making by playing the popular tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. The course is organized as half-seminar, half-game. The first class of the week is dedicated to lecture and discussion of primary literature papers. For the second class of the week, students meet in groups of six to play Dungeons and Dragons. In the game, students must apply what they learned to solve in-game problems. For example, they may use statistical concepts to prepare for and engage in battles, or use what they learn about cognitive fallacies to avoid falling prey to common errors in reasoning, or to exploit these errors in others. At the end of the course, students write a paper about one of the course topics, explaining the topic and how it applies to real-world contexts, supporting their arguments with literature, as well as how they applied it (or failed to apply it) in-game.
